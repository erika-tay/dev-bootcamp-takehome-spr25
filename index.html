      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Erika. I am a second year computer science major at Georgia Tech
        from Sugar Hill, Georgia. I am passionate about volunteering in my
        community for social good. In college, I have volunteered with China
        Care's monthly playgroups, which introduce Chinese culture to young
        adoptees in the Atlanta area. I volunteered at the Mid-Autumn Festival
        event organized by Tzu Ching chapters and the True Love organization to
        support kids with special needs. In high school, I taught elementary
        school students how to code. I love getting to know others and spending
        time with my family and friends.
